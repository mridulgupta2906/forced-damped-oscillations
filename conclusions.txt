1.  NO RESONANCE  => w1!=sqrt(a)  condition
        
        a.  Dependancy on b damping constant

            no Fext applied during this observation [ c=0 ] and hence no RESONANCE
        
            if b*b==0 : 
                SHM continous infinite OSCILLATIONS

            elif b*b==4*a*m:
                Critical Damping

            elif b*b<4*a*m:
                Under Damping 

            elif b*b>4*a*m:
                Over Damping



2.  RESONANCE    => w1=sqrt(a)  condition

        a.  Dependency on b damping constant
       
            Fext and w1 are not disturbed during this observation
            with increase in damping b = decrease in magnitude of amplitude  [ but oscillations becomes constant and infinite after some time ]

        b.  Dependancy on Fext

            b and w1 are not disturbedduring this observation
            with increase in Fext force magnitude amplitude increase







* RESONANCE only stops system from coming to rest ; magnitude of amplitude is dependent on b damping constant and Fext magnitude
